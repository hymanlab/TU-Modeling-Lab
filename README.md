# Website for Tulane Mathematical Modeling and Analysis Lab

  The **Tulane Mathematical Modeling and Analysis Lab** is focused on constructing new models for complex systems, analyzing the 
mathematical structure of these models, and quantifying the uncertainty in how well a model approximates the original physical 
or biological system.

  Our current areas of focus are centered around quantifying uncertainty and creating mathematical models based on the underlying 
transmission mechanisms of diseases to help the medical and scientific community to understand and anticipate the spread of a 
disease and to optimize the impact of prevention strategies on disease transmission.
